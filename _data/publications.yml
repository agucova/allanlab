    title: "Parallel organization of the avian sensorimotor arcopallium: Tectofugal
      visual pathway in the pigeon (Columba livia)."
    description: Abstract. The sensory–motor division of the avian arcopallium
      receives parallel inputs from primary and high‐order pallial areas of
      sensory and vocal control pathways, and sends a prominent descending
      projection to ascending and premotor, subpallial stages of these pathways.
      While this organization is well established for the auditory and
      trigeminal systems, the arcopallial subdivision related to the tectofugal
      visual system and its descending projection to the optic tectum (TeO) has
      been less investigated. In this study, we charted the arcopallial area
      displaying tectofugal visual responses and by injecting neural tracers, we
      traced its connectional anatomy. We found visual motion‐sensitive
      responses in a central region of the dorsal (AD) and intermediate (AI)
      arcopallium, in between previously described auditory and trigeminal
      zones. Blocking the ascending tectofugal sensory output, canceled these
      visual responses in the arcopallium, verifying their tectofugal origin.
      Injecting PHA‐L into the visual, but not into the auditory AI, revealed a
      massive projection to tectal layer 13 and other tectal related areas,
      sparing auditory, and trigeminal ones. Conversely, CTB injections
      restricted to TeO retrogradely labeled neurons confined to the visual AI.
      These results show that the AI zone receiving tectofugal inputs sends
      top‐down modulations specifically directed to tectal targets, just like
      the auditory and trigeminal AI zones project back to their respective
      subpallial sensory and premotor areas, as found by previous studies.
      Therefore, the arcopallium seems to be organized in a parallel fashion,
      such that in spite of expected cross‐modal integration, the different
      sensory–motor loops run through separate subdivisions of this structure.

      Abstract. Recent reports have shown that the avian visual dorsal
      ventricular ridge (DVR) is organized as a trilayered complex, in which the
      forming layers—the thalamo‐recipient entopallium (E), an overlaying
      nidopallial stripe called intermediate nidopallium (NI), and the dorsally
      adjacent mesopallium ventrale—appear to be extensively interconnected by
      topographically organized columns of reciprocal axonal processes running
      perpendicular to the layers, an arrangement highly reminiscent to that of
      the sensory cortices of mammals. In the present report, we implemented in
      vivo anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques aiming to elucidate the
      organization of the connections of this complex with other pallial areas.
      Previous studies have shown that the efferent projections of the visual
      DVR originate mainly from the NI and E, reaching several distinct
      associative and premotor nidopallial areas. We found that the efferents
      from the visual DVR originated solely from the NI, and confirmed that the
      targets of these projections were the pallial areas described by previous
      studies. We also found novel projections from the NI to the visual
      hyperpallium, and to the lateral striatum. Moreover, we found that these
      projections were reciprocal, topographically organized, and originated
      from different cell populations within the NI. We conclude that the NI
      constitutes a specialized layer of the visual DVR that form the core of a
      dense network of highly specific connections between this region and other
      higher order areas of the avian pallium. Finally, we discuss to what
      extent these hodological properties resemble those of the mammalian
      cortical layers II/III.

    title: Can social behaviour drive accessory olfactory bulb asymmetries? Sister
      species of caviomorph rodents as a case in point.
    description: Abstract. In mammals, the accessory olfactory or vomeronasal system
      exhibits a wide variety of anatomical arrangements. In caviomorph rodents,
      the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) exhibits a dichotomic conformation, in
      which two subdomains, the anterior (aAOB) and the posterior (pAOB), can be
      readily distinguished. Interestingly, different species of this group
      exhibit bias of different sign between the AOB subdomains (aAOB larger
      than pAOB or vice versa). Such species‐specific biases have been related
      with contrasting differences in the habitat of the different species (e.g.
      arid vs. humid environments). Aiming to deepen these observations, we
      performed a morphometric comparison of the AOB subdomains between two
      sister species of octodontid rodents, Octodon lunatus and Octodon degus.
      These species are interesting for comparative purposes, as they inhabit
      similar landscapes but exhibit contrasting social habits. Previous reports
      have shown that O. degus, a highly social species, exhibits a greatly
      asymmetric AOB, in which the aAOB has twice the size of the pAOB and
      features more and larger glomeruli in its glomerular layer (GL). We found
      that the same as in O. degus, the far less social O. lunatus also exhibits
      a bias, albeit less pronounced, to a larger aAOB. In both species, this
      bias was also evident for the mitral/tufted cells number. But unlike in O.
      degus, in O. lunatus this bias was not present at the GL. In comparison
      with O. degus, in O. lunatus the aAOB GL was significantly reduced in
      volume, while the pAOB GL displayed a similar volume. We conclude that
      these sister species exhibit a very sharp difference in the anatomical
      conformation of the AOB, namely, the relative size of the GL of the aAOB
      subdomain, which is larger in O. degus than in O. lunatus. We discuss
      these results in the context of the differences in the lifestyle of these
      species, highlighting the differences in social behaviour as a possible
      factor driving to distinct AOB morphometries.

    description: Abstract. A defining feature of the amniote tecto‐fugal visual
      pathway is a massive bilateral projection to the thalamus originating from
      a distinct neuronal population, tectal ganglion cells (TGCs), of the optic
      tectum/superior colliculus (TeO/SC). In sauropsids, the thalamic target of
      the tecto‐fugal pathway is the nucleus rotundus thalami (Rt). TGCs axons
      collateralize en route to Rt to target the nucleus pretectalis principalis
      (PT), which in turn gives rise to bilateral projection to the TeO. In
      rodents, the thalamic target of these TGCs afferents is the caudal
      division of the pulvinar complex (PulC). No pretectal structures in
      receipt of TGC collaterals have been described in this group. However,
      Baldwin et al. (Journal of Comparative Neurology, 2011;519(6):1071–1094)
      reported in the squirrel a feedback projection from the PulC to the SC.
      Pulvino‐tectal (Pul‐T) cells lie at the caudal pole of the PulC,
      intermingled with the axonal terminals of TGCs. Here, by performing a
      combination of neuronal tracing, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence,
      and in situ hybridization, we characterized the pattern of projections,
      neurochemical profile, and genoarchitecture of Pul‐T cells in the diurnal
      Chilean rodent Octodon degus. We found that Pul‐T neurons exhibit
      pretectal, but not thalamic, genoarchitectonical markers, as well as
      hodological and neurochemical properties that match specifically those of
      the avian nucleus PT. Thus, we propose that Pul‐T cells constitute a
      pretectal cell population hidden within the dorsal thalamus of mammals.
      Our results solve the oddity entailed by the apparent existence of a
      noncanonic descending sensory thalamic projection and further stress the
      conservative character of the tectofugal pathway.

    title: "Anatomical specializations related to foraging in the visual system of a
      nocturnal insectivorous bird, the Band-winged Nightjar (Aves:
      Caprimulgiformes)."
    description: "Abstract. Nocturnal animals that rely on their visual system for
      foraging, mating, and navigation usually exhibit specific traits
      associated with living in scotopic conditions. Most nocturnal birds have
      several visual specializations, such as enlarged eyes and an increased
      orbital convergence. However, the actual role of binocular vision in
      nocturnal foraging is still debated. Nightjars (Aves: Caprimulgidae) are
      predators that actively pursue and capture flying insects in crepuscular
      and nocturnal environments, mainly using a conspicuous “sit-and-wait”
      tactic on which pursuit begins with an insect flying over the bird that
      sits on the ground. In this study, we describe the visual system of the
      band-winged nightjar (Systellura longirostris), with emphasis on
      anatomical features previously described as relevant for nocturnal birds.
      Orbit convergence, determined by 3D scanning of the skull, was 73.28°. The
      visual field, determined by ophthalmoscopic reflex, exhibits an area of
      maximum binocular overlap of 42°, and it is dorsally oriented. The eyes
      showed a nocturnal-like normalized corneal aperture/axial length index.
      Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) were relatively scant, and distributed in an
      unusual oblique-band pattern, with higher concentrations in the
      ventrotemporal quadrant. Together, these results indicate that the
      band-winged nightjar exhibits a retinal specialization associated with the
      binocular area of their dorsal visual field, a relevant area for pursuit
      triggering and prey attacks. The RGC distribution observed is unusual
      among birds, but similar to that of some visually dependent insectivorous
      bats, suggesting that those features might be convergent in relation to
      feeding strategies."

    title: “Shepherd’s crook” neurons drive and synchronize the enhancing and
      suppressive mechanisms of the midbrain stimulus selection network.
    description: Abstract. The optic tectum (TeO), or superior colliculus, is a
      multisensory midbrain center that organizes spatially orienting responses
      to relevant stimuli. To define the stimulus with the highest priority at
      each moment, a network of reciprocal connections between the TeO and the
      isthmi promotes competition between concurrent tectal inputs. In the avian
      midbrain, the neurons mediating enhancement and suppression of tectal
      inputs are located in separate isthmic nuclei, facilitating the analysis
      of the neural processes that mediate competition. A specific subset of
      radial neurons in the intermediate tectal layers relay retinal inputs to
      the isthmi, but at present it is unclear whether separate neurons
      innervate individual nuclei or a single neural type sends a common input
      to several of them. In this study, we used in vitro neural tracing and
      cell-filling experiments in chickens to show that single neurons
      innervate, via axon collaterals, the three nuclei that comprise the
      isthmotectal network. This demonstrates that the input signals
      representing the strength of the incoming stimuli are simultaneously
      relayed to the mechanisms promoting both enhancement and suppression of
      the input signals. By performing in vivo recordings in anesthetized
      chicks, we also show that this common input generates synchrony between
      both antagonistic mechanisms, demonstrating that activity enhancement and
      suppression are closely coordinated. From a computational point of view,
      these results suggest that these tectal neurons constitute integrative
      nodes that combine inputs from different sources to drive in parallel
      several concurrent neural processes, each performing complementary
      functions within the network through different firing patterns and
      connectivity.

    title: Envelope analysis links oscillatory and arrhythmic EEG activities to two
      types of neuronal synchronization.
    authors: Díaz, J., Bassi, A., Coolen, A., Vivaldi, E. A., & Letelier, J. C. (2018)
    description: "Abstract. Traditionally, EEG is understood as originating from the
      synchronous activation of neuronal populations that generate rhythmic
      oscillations in specific frequency bands. Recently, new neuronal dynamics
      regimes have been identified (e.g. neuronal avalanches) characterized by
      irregular or arrhythmic activity. In addition, it is starting to be
      acknowledged that broadband properties of EEG spectrum (following a 1/f
      law) are tightly linked to brain function. Nevertheless, there is still no
      theoretical framework accommodating the coexistence of these two EEG
      phenomenologies: rhythmic/narrowband and arrhythmic/broadband. To address
      this problem, we present a new framework for EEG analysis based on the
      relation between the Gaussianity and the envelope of a given signal. EEG
      Gaussianity is a relevant assessment because if EEG emerges from the
      superposition of uncorrelated sources, it should exhibit properties of a
      Gaussian process, otherwise, as in the case of neural synchronization,
      deviations from Gaussianity should be observed. We use analytical results
      demonstrating that the coefficient of variation of the envelope (CVE) of
      Gaussian noise (or any of its filtered sub-bands) is the constant
      sqrt(4π−1)≈0.523, thus enabling CVE to be a useful metric to assess EEG
      Gaussianity. Furthermore, a new and highly informative analysis space
      (envelope characterization space) is generated by combining the CVE and
      the envelope average amplitude. We use this space to analyze rat EEG
      recordings during sleep-wake cycles. Our results show that delta, theta
      and sigma bands approach Gaussianity at the lowest EEG amplitudes while
      exhibiting significant deviations at high EEG amplitudes. Deviations to
      low-CVE appeared prominently during REM sleep, associated with theta
      rhythm, a regime consistent with the dynamics shown by the synchronization
      of weakly coupled oscillators. On the other hand, deviations to high-CVE,
      appearing mostly during NREM sleep associated with EEG phasic activity and
      high-amplitude Gaussian waves, can be interpreted as the arrhythmic
      superposition of transient neural synchronization events. These two
      different manifestations of neural synchrony (low-CVE/high-CVE) explain
      the well-known spectral differences between REM and NREM sleep, while also
      illuminating the origin of the EEG 1/f spectrum."

    title: "Selective binocular vision loss in two subterranean caviomorph rodents:
      Spalacopus cyanus and Ctenomys talarum."
    description: Abstract. To what extent can the mammalian visual system be shaped
      by visual behavior? Here we analyze the shape of the visual fields, the
      densities and distribution of cells in the retinal ganglion-cell layer and
      the organization of the visual projections in two species of facultative
      non-strictly subterranean rodents, Spalacopus cyanus and Ctenomys talarum,
      aiming to compare these traits with those of phylogenetically closely
      related species possessing contrasting diurnal/nocturnal visual habits. S.
      cyanus shows a definite zone of frontal binocular overlap and a
      corresponding area centralis, but a highly reduced amount of ipsilateral
      retinal projections. The situation in C. talarum is more extreme as it
      lacks of a fronto-ventral area of binocular superposition, has no
      recognizable area centralis and shows no ipsilateral retinal projections
      except to the suprachiasmatic nucleus. In both species, the extension of
      the monocular visual field and of the dorsal region of binocular overlap
      as well as the whole set of contralateral visual projections, appear
      well-developed. We conclude that these subterranean rodents exhibit,
      paradoxically, diurnal instead of nocturnal visual specializations, but at
      the same time suffer a specific regression of the anatomical substrate for
      stereopsis. We discuss these findings in light of the visual ecology of
      subterranean lifestyles.

    description: Abstract. The avian centrifugal visual system, which projects from
      the brain to the retina, has been intensively studied in several
      Neognathous birds that have a distinct isthmo‐optic nucleus (ION).
      However, birds of the order Palaeognathae seem to lack a proper ION in
      histologically stained brain sections. We had previously reported in the
      palaeognathous Chilean Tinamou (Nothoprocta perdicaria) that intraocular
      injections of Cholera Toxin B subunit retrogradely label a considerable
      number of neurons, which form a diffuse isthmo‐optic complex (IOC). In
      order to better understand how this IOC‐based centrifugal visual system is
      organized, we have studied its major components by means of in vivo and in
      vitro tracing experiments. Our results show that the IOC, though
      structurally less organized than an ION, possesses a dense core region
      consisting of multipolar neurons. It receives afferents from neurons in
      L10a of the optic tectum, which are distributed with a wider interneuronal
      spacing than in Neognathae. The tecto‐IOC terminals are delicate and
      divergent, unlike the prominent convergent tecto‐ION terminals in
      Neognathae. The centrifugal IOC terminals in the retina are exclusively
      divergent, resembling the terminals from “ectopic” centrifugal neurons in
      Neognathae. We conclude that the Tinamou's IOC participates in a
      comparable general IOC‐retina‐TeO‐IOC circuitry as the neognathous ION.
      However, the connections between the components are structurally different
      and their divergent character suggests a lower spatial resolution. Our
      findings call for further comparative studies in a broad range of species
      for advancing our understanding of the evolution, plasticity and
      functional roles of the avian centrifugal visual system.

    description: "Abstract. The avian pretectal and ventrothalamic nuclei,
      encompassing the griseum tectale (GT), n. lentiformis mesencephali (LM),
      and n. geniculatus lateralis pars ventralis (GLv), are prominent
      retinorecipient structures related to optic flow operations and visuomotor
      control. Hence, a close coordination of these neural circuits is to be
      expected. Yet the connectivity among these nuclei is poorly known. Here,
      using intracellular labeling and in situ hybridization, we investigated
      the detailed morphology, connectivity, and neurochemical identity of
      neurons in these nuclei. Two different cell types exist in the GT: one
      that generates an axonal projection to the optic tectum (TeO), LM, GLv,
      and n. intercalatus thalami (ICT), and a second population that only
      projects to the LM and GLv. In situ hybridization revealed that most
      neurons in the GT express the vesicular glutamate transporter (VGluT2)
      mRNA, indicating a glutamatergic identity. In the LM, three morphological
      cell types were defined, two of which project axons towards dorsal
      targets. The LM neurons showed strong VGluT2 expression. Finally, the
      cells located in the GLv project to the TeO, LM, GT, n. principalis
      precommisuralis (PPC), and ICT. All neurons in the GLv showed strong
      expression of the vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter (VIAAT)
      mRNA, suggesting a GABAergic identity. Our results show that the pretectal
      and ventrothalamic nuclei are highly interconnected, especially by

      This complex morphology and connectivity might be required to organize
      orienting visuomotor behaviors and coordinate the specific optic flow

    title: Effects of habitat and social complexity on brain size, brain asymmetry
      and dentate gyrus morphology in two octodontid rodents.
    description: Abstract. Navigational and social challenges due to habitat
      conditions and sociality are known to influence dentate gyrus (DG)
      morphology, yet the relative importance of these factors remains unclear.
      Thus, we studied three natural populations of O. lunatus (Los Molles) and
      Octodon degus (El Salitre and Rinconada), two caviomorph species that
      differ in the extent of sociality and with contrasting vegetation cover of
      habitat used. The brains and DG of male and female breeding degus with
      simultaneous information on their physical and social environments were
      examined. The extent of sociality was quantified from total group size and
      range area overlap. O. degus at El Salitre was more social than at
      Rinconada and than O. lunatus from Los Molles. The use of transects to
      quantify cover of vegetation (and other physical objects in the habitat)
      and measures of the spatial behavior of animals indicated animal
      navigation based on unique cues or global landmarks is more cognitively
      challenging to O. lunatus. During lactation, female O. lunatus had larger
      brains than males. Relative DG volume was similar across sexes and
      populations. The right hemisphere of male and female O. lunatus had more
      cells than the left hemisphere, with DG directional asymmetry not found in
      O. degus. Degu population differences in brain size and DG cell number
      seemed more responsive to differences in habitat than to differences in
      sociality. Yet, large-sized O. degus (but not O. lunatus) that ranged over
      larger areas and were members of larger social groups had more DG cells
      per hemisphere. Thus, within-population variation in DG cell number by
      hemisphere was consistent with a joint influence of habitat and sociality
      in O. degus at El Salitre.

    title: Bird embryos uncover homology and evolution of the dinosaur ankle.
    description: The anklebone (astragalus) of dinosaurs presents a characteristic
      upward projection, the ‘ascending process’ (ASC). The ASC is present in
      modern birds, but develops a separate ossification centre, and projects
      from the calcaneum in most species. These differences have been argued to
      make it non-comparable to dinosaurs. We studied ASC development in six
      different orders of birds using traditional techniques and spin–disc
      microscopy for whole-mount immunofluorescence. Unexpectedly, we found the
      ASC derives from the embryonic intermedium, an ancient element of the
      tetrapod ankle. In some birds it comes in contact with the astragalus,
      and, in others, with the calcaneum. The fact that the intermedium fails to
      fuse early with the tibiale and develops an ossification centre is unlike
      any other amniotes, yet resembles basal, amphibian-grade tetrapods. The
      ASC originated in early dinosaurs along changes to upright posture and
      locomotion, revealing an intriguing combination of functional innovation
      and reversion in its evolution.

    title: Copper enhances cellular and network excitabilities, and improves
      temporal processing in the rat hippocampus.

    description: "Abstract. Copper, an ion with many important metabolic functions,
      has also been proposed to have a role as modulator on neuronal function,
      mostly based on its effects on voltage‐ and neurotransmitter‐gated
      conductance as well as on neurological symptoms of patients with altered
      copper homeostasis. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which copper exerts
      its neuromodulatory effects have not been clearly established in a
      functional neuronal network. Using rat hippocampus slices as a neuronal
      network model, the effects of copper in the range of 10–100 nm were tested
      on the intrinsic, synaptic and network properties of the CA1 region. Most
      of the previously described effects of this cation were in the micromolar
      range of copper concentrations. The current results indicate that copper
      is a multifaceted neuromodulator, having effects that may be grouped into
      two categories: (i) activity enhancement, by modulating synaptic
      communication and action potential (AP) conductances; and (ii) temporal
      processing and correlation extraction, by improving reliability and
      depressing inhibition. Specifically it was found that copper
      hyperpolarizes AP firing threshold, enhances neuronal and network
      excitability, modifies CA3–CA1 pathway gain, enhances the frequency of
      spontaneous synaptic events, decreases inhibitory network activity, and
      improves AP timing reliability. Moreover, copper chelation by
      bathocuproine decreases spontaneous network spiking activity. These
      results allow the proposal that copper affects the network activity from
      cellular to circuit levels on a moment‐by‐moment basis, and should be
      considered a crucial functional component of hippocampal neuronal
      circuitry."

    title: Early olfactory environment influences social behaviour in adult octodon
      degus.
    description: "Abstract. We evaluated the extent to which manipulation of early
      olfactory environment can influence social behaviours in the South
      American Hystricognath rodent Octodon degus. The early olfactory
      environment of newborn degus was manipulated by scenting all litter
      members with eucalyptol during the first month of life. The social
      behaviour of sexually mature animals (5–7 months old) towards conspecifics
      was then assessed using a y-maze to compare the response of control
      (naïve) and treated animals to two different olfactory configurations
      (experiment 1): (i) a non-familiarized conspecific impregnated with
      eucalyptol (eucalyptol arm) presented against (ii) a non-familiarized
      unscented conspecific (control arm). In addition, in dyadic encounters, we
      assessed the behaviour of control and eucalyptol treated animals towards a
      non-familiarized conspecific scented with eucalyptol (experiment 2). We
      found that control subjects explored and spent significantly less time in
      the eucalyptol arm, indicating neophobic behaviours towards the
      artificially scented conspecific. Treated subjects explored and spent
      similar time in both arms of the maze, showing the same interest for both
      olfactory stimuli presented. During dyadic encounters in experiment 2, an
      interaction effect between early experience and sex was observed. Control
      males escaped and avoided their scented partner more frequently than
      eucalyptol treated male subjects and than females. Both groups did not
      differ in the exploration of their scented partners, suggesting that
      avoidance within agonistic context does not relate to neophobic
      behaviours. Our results suggest that the exposure to eucalyptol during
      early ontogeny decreases evasive behaviours within an agonistic context as
      a result of olfactory learning. Altogether, these results indicate that
      olfactory cues learned in early ontogeny can influence olfactory-guided
      behaviours in adult degus."

    description: "Abstract. Most systematic studies of the avian visual system have
      focused on Neognathous species, leaving virtually unexplored the
      Palaeognathae, comprised of the flightless ratites and the South American
      tinamous. We investigated the visual field, the retinal topography, and
      the pattern of retinal and centrifugal projections in the Chilean tinamou,
      a small Palaeognath of the family Tinamidae. The tinamou has a panoramic
      visual field with a small frontal binocular overlap of 20°. The retina
      possesses three distinct topographic specializations: a horizontal visual
      streak, a dorsotemporal area, and an area centralis with a shallow fovea.
      The maximum ganglion cell density is 61,900/ mm2, comparable to
      Falconiformes. This would provide a maximal visual acuity of 14.0
      cycles/degree, in spite of relatively small eyes. The central retinal
      projections generally conform to the characteristic arrangement observed
      in Neognathae, with well‐differentiated contralateral targets and very few
      ipsilateral fibers. The centrifugal visual system is composed of a
      considerable number of multipolar centrifugal neurons, resembling the
      “ectopic” neurons described in Neognathae. They form a diffuse nuclear
      structure, which may correspond to the ancestral condition shared with
      other sauropsids. A notable feature is the presence of terminals in deep
      tectal layers 11–13. These fibers may represent either a novel
      retinotectal pathway or collateral branches from centrifugal neurons
      projecting to the retina. Both types of connections have been described in
      chicken embryos. Our results widen the basis for comparative studies of
      the vertebrate visual system, stressing the conserved character of the
      visual projections' pattern within the avian clade."

    title: "The isthmic nuclei providing parallel feedback connections to the avian
      tectum have different neurochemical identities: Expression of
      glutamatergic and cholinergic markers in the chick (Gallus gallus)."
    description: "Abstract. Retinal inputs to the optic tectum (TeO) triggered by
      moving stimuli elicit synchronized feedback signals from two isthmic
      nuclei: the isthmi parvocelullaris (Ipc) and isthmi semilunaris (SLu).
      Both of these nuclei send columnar axon terminals back to the same tectal
      position receiving the retinal input. The feedback signals from the Ipc
      seem to act as an attentional spotlight by selectively boosting the
      propagation of retinal inputs from the tectum to higher visual areas.
      Although Ipc and SLu nuclei are widely considered cholinergic because of
      their immunoreactivity for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), contradictory
      findings, including the expression of the vesicular glutamate transporter
      2 (VGluT2) mRNA in Ipc neurons, have raised doubts about the purely
      cholinergic nature of this nucleus. In this study, in chicks, we revise
      the neurochemical identity of the isthmic nuclei by using in situ
      hybridization assays for VGluT2 along with three cholinergic markers: the
      vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), the high‐affinity choline
      transporter (CHT1) and ChAT. We found that neurons in the SLu showed
      strong mRNA expression of all three cholinergic markers, whereas the
      expression of VAChT mRNA in the Ipc was undetectable in our essays.
      Instead, Ipc neurons exhibited a strong expression of VGluT2 mRNA.
      Immunohistochemistry assays showed VGluT2 immunoreactivity in the TeO
      codistributing with anterogradely labeled Ipc axon‐terminal boutons,
      further supporting a glutamatergic function for the Ipc nucleus.
      Therefore, our results strongly suggest that, in the chick, whereas the
      feedback from the SLu to the TeO is indeed cholinergic, the feedback from
      the Ipc has a marked glutamatergic component."

    description: Abstract. Most birds have an opposable digit 1 (hallux) allowing
      the foot to grasp, which evolved from the non-opposable hallux of early
      theropod dinosaurs. An important morphological difference with early
      theropods is the twisting of the long axis of its metatarsal. Here, we
      show how embryonic musculature and the onset of its activity are required
      for twisting of metatarsal 1 (Mt1) and retroversion of the hallux.
      Pharmacologically paralyzed embryos do not fully retrovert the hallux and
      have a straight Mt1 shaft, phenocopying the morphology of early tetanuran
      dinosaurs. Molecular markers of cartilage maturation and ossification show
      that differentiation of Mt1 is significantly delayed compared to Mt2-4. We
      hypothesize on how delayed maturation may have increased plasticity,
      facilitating muscular twisting. Our experimental results emphasize the
      importance of embryonic muscular activity in the evolutionary origin of a
      crucial adaptation.

    description: Abstract. There are ganglion cells in the pigeon retina that
      respond selectively, some to any edge moving in a particular direction
      only, others to any vertically moving horizontal edge. This selective
      response to a specific stimulus arises from the selective sensitivity of
      each neuron to a particular spatiotemporal configuration in its afferent
      influences, and is independent of specific pathways.
