    title: Directional Movement and Horizontal Edge Detectors in the Pigeon Retina
    image: ""
    description: Abstract. There are ganglion cells in the pigeon retina that
      respond selectively, some to any edge moving in a particular direction
      only, others to any vertically moving horizontal edge. This selective
      response to a specific stimulus arises from the selective sensitivity of
      each neuron to a particular spatiotemporal configuration in its afferent
      influences, and is independent of specific pathways.

      Abstract. Recent reports have shown that the avian visual dorsal
      ventricular ridge (DVR) is organized as a trilayered complex, in which the
      forming layers—the thalamo‐recipient entopallium (E), an overlaying
      nidopallial stripe called intermediate nidopallium (NI), and the dorsally
      adjacent mesopallium ventrale—appear to be extensively interconnected by
      topographically organized columns of reciprocal axonal processes running
      perpendicular to the layers, an arrangement highly reminiscent to that of
      the sensory cortices of mammals. In the present report, we implemented in
      vivo anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques aiming to elucidate the
      organization of the connections of this complex with other pallial areas.
      Previous studies have shown that the efferent projections of the visual
      DVR originate mainly from the NI and E, reaching several distinct
      associative and premotor nidopallial areas. We found that the efferents
      from the visual DVR originated solely from the NI, and confirmed that the
      targets of these projections were the pallial areas described by previous
      studies. We also found novel projections from the NI to the visual
      hyperpallium, and to the lateral striatum. Moreover, we found that these
      projections were reciprocal, topographically organized, and originated
      from different cell populations within the NI. We conclude that the NI
      constitutes a specialized layer of the visual DVR that form the core of a
      dense network of highly specific connections between this region and other
      higher order areas of the avian pallium. Finally, we discuss to what
      extent these hodological properties resemble those of the mammalian
      cortical layers II/III.
