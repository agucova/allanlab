    title: "Parallel organization of the avian sensorimotor arcopallium: Tectofugal
      visual pathway in the pigeon (Columba livia)."
    description: Abstract. The sensory–motor division of the avian arcopallium
      receives parallel inputs from primary and high‐order pallial areas of
      sensory and vocal control pathways, and sends a prominent descending
      projection to ascending and premotor, subpallial stages of these pathways.
      While this organization is well established for the auditory and
      trigeminal systems, the arcopallial subdivision related to the tectofugal
      visual system and its descending projection to the optic tectum (TeO) has
      been less investigated. In this study, we charted the arcopallial area
      displaying tectofugal visual responses and by injecting neural tracers, we
      traced its connectional anatomy. We found visual motion‐sensitive
      responses in a central region of the dorsal (AD) and intermediate (AI)
      arcopallium, in between previously described auditory and trigeminal
      zones. Blocking the ascending tectofugal sensory output, canceled these
      visual responses in the arcopallium, verifying their tectofugal origin.
      Injecting PHA‐L into the visual, but not into the auditory AI, revealed a
      massive projection to tectal layer 13 and other tectal related areas,
      sparing auditory, and trigeminal ones. Conversely, CTB injections
      restricted to TeO retrogradely labeled neurons confined to the visual AI.
      These results show that the AI zone receiving tectofugal inputs sends
      top‐down modulations specifically directed to tectal targets, just like
      the auditory and trigeminal AI zones project back to their respective
      subpallial sensory and premotor areas, as found by previous studies.
      Therefore, the arcopallium seems to be organized in a parallel fashion,
      such that in spite of expected cross‐modal integration, the different
      sensory–motor loops run through separate subdivisions of this structure.

      Abstract. Recent reports have shown that the avian visual dorsal
      ventricular ridge (DVR) is organized as a trilayered complex, in which the
      forming layers—the thalamo‐recipient entopallium (E), an overlaying
      nidopallial stripe called intermediate nidopallium (NI), and the dorsally
      adjacent mesopallium ventrale—appear to be extensively interconnected by
      topographically organized columns of reciprocal axonal processes running
      perpendicular to the layers, an arrangement highly reminiscent to that of
      the sensory cortices of mammals. In the present report, we implemented in
      vivo anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques aiming to elucidate the
      organization of the connections of this complex with other pallial areas.
      Previous studies have shown that the efferent projections of the visual
      DVR originate mainly from the NI and E, reaching several distinct
      associative and premotor nidopallial areas. We found that the efferents
      from the visual DVR originated solely from the NI, and confirmed that the
      targets of these projections were the pallial areas described by previous
      studies. We also found novel projections from the NI to the visual
      hyperpallium, and to the lateral striatum. Moreover, we found that these
      projections were reciprocal, topographically organized, and originated
      from different cell populations within the NI. We conclude that the NI
      constitutes a specialized layer of the visual DVR that form the core of a
      dense network of highly specific connections between this region and other
      higher order areas of the avian pallium. Finally, we discuss to what
      extent these hodological properties resemble those of the mammalian
      cortical layers II/III.

    title: "Anatomical specializations related to foraging in the visual system of a
      nocturnal insectivorous bird, the Band-winged Nightjar (Aves:
      Caprimulgiformes)."
    description: "Abstract. Nocturnal animals that rely on their visual system for
      foraging, mating, and navigation usually exhibit specific traits
      associated with living in scotopic conditions. Most nocturnal birds have
      several visual specializations, such as enlarged eyes and an increased
      orbital convergence. However, the actual role of binocular vision in
      nocturnal foraging is still debated. Nightjars (Aves: Caprimulgidae) are
      predators that actively pursue and capture flying insects in crepuscular
      and nocturnal environments, mainly using a conspicuous “sit-and-wait”
      tactic on which pursuit begins with an insect flying over the bird that
      sits on the ground. In this study, we describe the visual system of the
      band-winged nightjar (Systellura longirostris), with emphasis on
      anatomical features previously described as relevant for nocturnal birds.
      Orbit convergence, determined by 3D scanning of the skull, was 73.28°. The
      visual field, determined by ophthalmoscopic reflex, exhibits an area of
      maximum binocular overlap of 42°, and it is dorsally oriented. The eyes
      showed a nocturnal-like normalized corneal aperture/axial length index.
      Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) were relatively scant, and distributed in an
      unusual oblique-band pattern, with higher concentrations in the
      ventrotemporal quadrant. Together, these results indicate that the
      band-winged nightjar exhibits a retinal specialization associated with the
      binocular area of their dorsal visual field, a relevant area for pursuit
      triggering and prey attacks. The RGC distribution observed is unusual
      among birds, but similar to that of some visually dependent insectivorous
      bats, suggesting that those features might be convergent in relation to
      feeding strategies."

    title: Directional movement and horizontal edge detectors in the pigeon retina.
    image: ""
    description: Abstract. There are ganglion cells in the pigeon retina that
      respond selectively, some to any edge moving in a particular direction
      only, others to any vertically moving horizontal edge. This selective
      response to a specific stimulus arises from the selective sensitivity of
      each neuron to a particular spatiotemporal configuration in its afferent
      influences, and is independent of specific pathways.
