    title: "Parallel organization of the avian sensorimotor arcopallium: Tectofugal
      visual pathway in the pigeon (Columba livia)."
    description: Abstract. The sensory–motor division of the avian arcopallium
      receives parallel inputs from primary and high‐order pallial areas of
      sensory and vocal control pathways, and sends a prominent descending
      projection to ascending and premotor, subpallial stages of these pathways.
      While this organization is well established for the auditory and
      trigeminal systems, the arcopallial subdivision related to the tectofugal
      visual system and its descending projection to the optic tectum (TeO) has
      been less investigated. In this study, we charted the arcopallial area
      displaying tectofugal visual responses and by injecting neural tracers, we
      traced its connectional anatomy. We found visual motion‐sensitive
      responses in a central region of the dorsal (AD) and intermediate (AI)
      arcopallium, in between previously described auditory and trigeminal
      zones. Blocking the ascending tectofugal sensory output, canceled these
      visual responses in the arcopallium, verifying their tectofugal origin.
      Injecting PHA‐L into the visual, but not into the auditory AI, revealed a
      massive projection to tectal layer 13 and other tectal related areas,
      sparing auditory, and trigeminal ones. Conversely, CTB injections
      restricted to TeO retrogradely labeled neurons confined to the visual AI.
      These results show that the AI zone receiving tectofugal inputs sends
      top‐down modulations specifically directed to tectal targets, just like
      the auditory and trigeminal AI zones project back to their respective
      subpallial sensory and premotor areas, as found by previous studies.
      Therefore, the arcopallium seems to be organized in a parallel fashion,
      such that in spite of expected cross‐modal integration, the different
      sensory–motor loops run through separate subdivisions of this structure.

      Abstract. Recent reports have shown that the avian visual dorsal
      ventricular ridge (DVR) is organized as a trilayered complex, in which the
      forming layers—the thalamo‐recipient entopallium (E), an overlaying
      nidopallial stripe called intermediate nidopallium (NI), and the dorsally
      adjacent mesopallium ventrale—appear to be extensively interconnected by
      topographically organized columns of reciprocal axonal processes running
      perpendicular to the layers, an arrangement highly reminiscent to that of
      the sensory cortices of mammals. In the present report, we implemented in
      vivo anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques aiming to elucidate the
      organization of the connections of this complex with other pallial areas.
      Previous studies have shown that the efferent projections of the visual
      DVR originate mainly from the NI and E, reaching several distinct
      associative and premotor nidopallial areas. We found that the efferents
      from the visual DVR originated solely from the NI, and confirmed that the
      targets of these projections were the pallial areas described by previous
      studies. We also found novel projections from the NI to the visual
      hyperpallium, and to the lateral striatum. Moreover, we found that these
      projections were reciprocal, topographically organized, and originated
      from different cell populations within the NI. We conclude that the NI
      constitutes a specialized layer of the visual DVR that form the core of a
      dense network of highly specific connections between this region and other
      higher order areas of the avian pallium. Finally, we discuss to what
      extent these hodological properties resemble those of the mammalian
      cortical layers II/III.

    title: Can social behaviour drive accessory olfactory bulb asymmetries? Sister
      species of caviomorph rodents as a case in point.
    description: Abstract. In mammals, the accessory olfactory or vomeronasal system
      exhibits a wide variety of anatomical arrangements. In caviomorph rodents,
      the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) exhibits a dichotomic conformation, in
      which two subdomains, the anterior (aAOB) and the posterior (pAOB), can be
      readily distinguished. Interestingly, different species of this group
      exhibit bias of different sign between the AOB subdomains (aAOB larger
      than pAOB or vice versa). Such species‐specific biases have been related
      with contrasting differences in the habitat of the different species (e.g.
      arid vs. humid environments). Aiming to deepen these observations, we
      performed a morphometric comparison of the AOB subdomains between two
      sister species of octodontid rodents, Octodon lunatus and Octodon degus.
      These species are interesting for comparative purposes, as they inhabit
      similar landscapes but exhibit contrasting social habits. Previous reports
      have shown that O. degus, a highly social species, exhibits a greatly
      asymmetric AOB, in which the aAOB has twice the size of the pAOB and
      features more and larger glomeruli in its glomerular layer (GL). We found
      that the same as in O. degus, the far less social O. lunatus also exhibits
      a bias, albeit less pronounced, to a larger aAOB. In both species, this
      bias was also evident for the mitral/tufted cells number. But unlike in O.
      degus, in O. lunatus this bias was not present at the GL. In comparison
      with O. degus, in O. lunatus the aAOB GL was significantly reduced in
      volume, while the pAOB GL displayed a similar volume. We conclude that
      these sister species exhibit a very sharp difference in the anatomical
      conformation of the AOB, namely, the relative size of the GL of the aAOB
      subdomain, which is larger in O. degus than in O. lunatus. We discuss
      these results in the context of the differences in the lifestyle of these
      species, highlighting the differences in social behaviour as a possible
      factor driving to distinct AOB morphometries.

    description: Abstract. A defining feature of the amniote tecto‐fugal visual
      pathway is a massive bilateral projection to the thalamus originating from
      a distinct neuronal population, tectal ganglion cells (TGCs), of the optic
      tectum/superior colliculus (TeO/SC). In sauropsids, the thalamic target of
      the tecto‐fugal pathway is the nucleus rotundus thalami (Rt). TGCs axons
      collateralize en route to Rt to target the nucleus pretectalis principalis
      (PT), which in turn gives rise to bilateral projection to the TeO. In
      rodents, the thalamic target of these TGCs afferents is the caudal
      division of the pulvinar complex (PulC). No pretectal structures in
      receipt of TGC collaterals have been described in this group. However,
      Baldwin et al. (Journal of Comparative Neurology, 2011;519(6):1071–1094)
      reported in the squirrel a feedback projection from the PulC to the SC.
      Pulvino‐tectal (Pul‐T) cells lie at the caudal pole of the PulC,
      intermingled with the axonal terminals of TGCs. Here, by performing a
      combination of neuronal tracing, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence,
      and in situ hybridization, we characterized the pattern of projections,
      neurochemical profile, and genoarchitecture of Pul‐T cells in the diurnal
      Chilean rodent Octodon degus. We found that Pul‐T neurons exhibit
      pretectal, but not thalamic, genoarchitectonical markers, as well as
      hodological and neurochemical properties that match specifically those of
      the avian nucleus PT. Thus, we propose that Pul‐T cells constitute a
      pretectal cell population hidden within the dorsal thalamus of mammals.
      Our results solve the oddity entailed by the apparent existence of a
      noncanonic descending sensory thalamic projection and further stress the
      conservative character of the tectofugal pathway.

    title: "Anatomical specializations related to foraging in the visual system of a
      nocturnal insectivorous bird, the Band-winged Nightjar (Aves:
      Caprimulgiformes)."
    description: "Abstract. Nocturnal animals that rely on their visual system for
      foraging, mating, and navigation usually exhibit specific traits
      associated with living in scotopic conditions. Most nocturnal birds have
      several visual specializations, such as enlarged eyes and an increased
      orbital convergence. However, the actual role of binocular vision in
      nocturnal foraging is still debated. Nightjars (Aves: Caprimulgidae) are
      predators that actively pursue and capture flying insects in crepuscular
      and nocturnal environments, mainly using a conspicuous “sit-and-wait”
      tactic on which pursuit begins with an insect flying over the bird that
      sits on the ground. In this study, we describe the visual system of the
      band-winged nightjar (Systellura longirostris), with emphasis on
      anatomical features previously described as relevant for nocturnal birds.
      Orbit convergence, determined by 3D scanning of the skull, was 73.28°. The
      visual field, determined by ophthalmoscopic reflex, exhibits an area of
      maximum binocular overlap of 42°, and it is dorsally oriented. The eyes
      showed a nocturnal-like normalized corneal aperture/axial length index.
      Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) were relatively scant, and distributed in an
      unusual oblique-band pattern, with higher concentrations in the
      ventrotemporal quadrant. Together, these results indicate that the
      band-winged nightjar exhibits a retinal specialization associated with the
      binocular area of their dorsal visual field, a relevant area for pursuit
      triggering and prey attacks. The RGC distribution observed is unusual
      among birds, but similar to that of some visually dependent insectivorous
      bats, suggesting that those features might be convergent in relation to
      feeding strategies."

    title: “Shepherd’s crook” neurons drive and synchronize the enhancing and
      suppressive mechanisms of the midbrain stimulus selection network.
    description: Abstract. The optic tectum (TeO), or superior colliculus, is a
      multisensory midbrain center that organizes spatially orienting responses
      to relevant stimuli. To define the stimulus with the highest priority at
      each moment, a network of reciprocal connections between the TeO and the
      isthmi promotes competition between concurrent tectal inputs. In the avian
      midbrain, the neurons mediating enhancement and suppression of tectal
      inputs are located in separate isthmic nuclei, facilitating the analysis
      of the neural processes that mediate competition. A specific subset of
      radial neurons in the intermediate tectal layers relay retinal inputs to
      the isthmi, but at present it is unclear whether separate neurons
      innervate individual nuclei or a single neural type sends a common input
      to several of them. In this study, we used in vitro neural tracing and
      cell-filling experiments in chickens to show that single neurons
      innervate, via axon collaterals, the three nuclei that comprise the
      isthmotectal network. This demonstrates that the input signals
      representing the strength of the incoming stimuli are simultaneously
      relayed to the mechanisms promoting both enhancement and suppression of
      the input signals. By performing in vivo recordings in anesthetized
      chicks, we also show that this common input generates synchrony between
      both antagonistic mechanisms, demonstrating that activity enhancement and
      suppression are closely coordinated. From a computational point of view,
      these results suggest that these tectal neurons constitute integrative
      nodes that combine inputs from different sources to drive in parallel
      several concurrent neural processes, each performing complementary
      functions within the network through different firing patterns and
      connectivity.

    title: Envelope analysis links oscillatory and arrhythmic EEG activities to two
      types of neuronal synchronization.
    authors: Díaz, J., Bassi, A., Coolen, A., Vivaldi, E. A., & Letelier, J. C. (2018)
    description: "Abstract. Traditionally, EEG is understood as originating from the
      synchronous activation of neuronal populations that generate rhythmic
      oscillations in specific frequency bands. Recently, new neuronal dynamics
      regimes have been identified (e.g. neuronal avalanches) characterized by
      irregular or arrhythmic activity. In addition, it is starting to be
      acknowledged that broadband properties of EEG spectrum (following a 1/f
      law) are tightly linked to brain function. Nevertheless, there is still no
      theoretical framework accommodating the coexistence of these two EEG
      phenomenologies: rhythmic/narrowband and arrhythmic/broadband. To address
      this problem, we present a new framework for EEG analysis based on the
      relation between the Gaussianity and the envelope of a given signal. EEG
      Gaussianity is a relevant assessment because if EEG emerges from the
      superposition of uncorrelated sources, it should exhibit properties of a
      Gaussian process, otherwise, as in the case of neural synchronization,
      deviations from Gaussianity should be observed. We use analytical results
      demonstrating that the coefficient of variation of the envelope (CVE) of
      Gaussian noise (or any of its filtered sub-bands) is the constant
      sqrt(4π−1)≈0.523, thus enabling CVE to be a useful metric to assess EEG
      Gaussianity. Furthermore, a new and highly informative analysis space
      (envelope characterization space) is generated by combining the CVE and
      the envelope average amplitude. We use this space to analyze rat EEG
      recordings during sleep-wake cycles. Our results show that delta, theta
      and sigma bands approach Gaussianity at the lowest EEG amplitudes while
      exhibiting significant deviations at high EEG amplitudes. Deviations to
      low-CVE appeared prominently during REM sleep, associated with theta
      rhythm, a regime consistent with the dynamics shown by the synchronization
      of weakly coupled oscillators. On the other hand, deviations to high-CVE,
      appearing mostly during NREM sleep associated with EEG phasic activity and
      high-amplitude Gaussian waves, can be interpreted as the arrhythmic
      superposition of transient neural synchronization events. These two
      different manifestations of neural synchrony (low-CVE/high-CVE) explain
      the well-known spectral differences between REM and NREM sleep, while also
      illuminating the origin of the EEG 1/f spectrum."

    title: "Selective binocular vision loss in two subterranean caviomorph rodents:
      Spalacopus cyanus and Ctenomys talarum."
    description: Abstract. To what extent can the mammalian visual system be shaped
      by visual behavior? Here we analyze the shape of the visual fields, the
      densities and distribution of cells in the retinal ganglion-cell layer and
      the organization of the visual projections in two species of facultative
      non-strictly subterranean rodents, Spalacopus cyanus and Ctenomys talarum,
      aiming to compare these traits with those of phylogenetically closely
      related species possessing contrasting diurnal/nocturnal visual habits. S.
      cyanus shows a definite zone of frontal binocular overlap and a
      corresponding area centralis, but a highly reduced amount of ipsilateral
      retinal projections. The situation in C. talarum is more extreme as it
      lacks of a fronto-ventral area of binocular superposition, has no
      recognizable area centralis and shows no ipsilateral retinal projections
      except to the suprachiasmatic nucleus. In both species, the extension of
      the monocular visual field and of the dorsal region of binocular overlap
      as well as the whole set of contralateral visual projections, appear
      well-developed. We conclude that these subterranean rodents exhibit,
      paradoxically, diurnal instead of nocturnal visual specializations, but at
      the same time suffer a specific regression of the anatomical substrate for
      stereopsis. We discuss these findings in light of the visual ecology of
      subterranean lifestyles.

    description: Abstract. The avian centrifugal visual system, which projects from
      the brain to the retina, has been intensively studied in several
      Neognathous birds that have a distinct isthmo‐optic nucleus (ION).
      However, birds of the order Palaeognathae seem to lack a proper ION in
      histologically stained brain sections. We had previously reported in the
      palaeognathous Chilean Tinamou (Nothoprocta perdicaria) that intraocular
      injections of Cholera Toxin B subunit retrogradely label a considerable
      number of neurons, which form a diffuse isthmo‐optic complex (IOC). In
      order to better understand how this IOC‐based centrifugal visual system is
      organized, we have studied its major components by means of in vivo and in
      vitro tracing experiments. Our results show that the IOC, though
      structurally less organized than an ION, possesses a dense core region
      consisting of multipolar neurons. It receives afferents from neurons in
      L10a of the optic tectum, which are distributed with a wider interneuronal
      spacing than in Neognathae. The tecto‐IOC terminals are delicate and
      divergent, unlike the prominent convergent tecto‐ION terminals in
      Neognathae. The centrifugal IOC terminals in the retina are exclusively
      divergent, resembling the terminals from “ectopic” centrifugal neurons in
      Neognathae. We conclude that the Tinamou's IOC participates in a
      comparable general IOC‐retina‐TeO‐IOC circuitry as the neognathous ION.
      However, the connections between the components are structurally different
      and their divergent character suggests a lower spatial resolution. Our
      findings call for further comparative studies in a broad range of species
      for advancing our understanding of the evolution, plasticity and
      functional roles of the avian centrifugal visual system.

    description: "Abstract. The avian pretectal and ventrothalamic nuclei,
      encompassing the griseum tectale (GT), n. lentiformis mesencephali (LM),
      and n. geniculatus lateralis pars ventralis (GLv), are prominent
      retinorecipient structures related to optic flow operations and visuomotor
      control. Hence, a close coordination of these neural circuits is to be
      expected. Yet the connectivity among these nuclei is poorly known. Here,
      using intracellular labeling and in situ hybridization, we investigated
      the detailed morphology, connectivity, and neurochemical identity of
      neurons in these nuclei. Two different cell types exist in the GT: one
      that generates an axonal projection to the optic tectum (TeO), LM, GLv,
      and n. intercalatus thalami (ICT), and a second population that only
      projects to the LM and GLv. In situ hybridization revealed that most
      neurons in the GT express the vesicular glutamate transporter (VGluT2)
      mRNA, indicating a glutamatergic identity. In the LM, three morphological
      cell types were defined, two of which project axons towards dorsal
      targets. The LM neurons showed strong VGluT2 expression. Finally, the
      cells located in the GLv project to the TeO, LM, GT, n. principalis
      precommisuralis (PPC), and ICT. All neurons in the GLv showed strong
      expression of the vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter (VIAAT)
      mRNA, suggesting a GABAergic identity. Our results show that the pretectal
      and ventrothalamic nuclei are highly interconnected, especially by

      orienting visuomotor behaviors and coordinate the specific optic flow

    title: Effects of habitat and social complexity on brain size, brain asymmetry
      and dentate gyrus morphology in two octodontid rodents.
    description: Abstract. Navigational and social challenges due to habitat
      conditions and sociality are known to influence dentate gyrus (DG)
      morphology, yet the relative importance of these factors remains unclear.
      Thus, we studied three natural populations of O. lunatus (Los Molles) and
      Octodon degus (El Salitre and Rinconada), two caviomorph species that
      differ in the extent of sociality and with contrasting vegetation cover of
      habitat used. The brains and DG of male and female breeding degus with
      simultaneous information on their physical and social environments were
      examined. The extent of sociality was quantified from total group size and
      range area overlap. O. degus at El Salitre was more social than at
      Rinconada and than O. lunatus from Los Molles. The use of transects to
      quantify cover of vegetation (and other physical objects in the habitat)
      and measures of the spatial behavior of animals indicated animal
      navigation based on unique cues or global landmarks is more cognitively
      challenging to O. lunatus. During lactation, female O. lunatus had larger
      brains than males. Relative DG volume was similar across sexes and
      populations. The right hemisphere of male and female O. lunatus had more
      cells than the left hemisphere, with DG directional asymmetry not found in
      O. degus. Degu population differences in brain size and DG cell number
      seemed more responsive to differences in habitat than to differences in
      sociality. Yet, large-sized O. degus (but not O. lunatus) that ranged over
      larger areas and were members of larger social groups had more DG cells
      per hemisphere. Thus, within-population variation in DG cell number by
      hemisphere was consistent with a joint influence of habitat and sociality
      in O. degus at El Salitre.

    title: Bird embryos uncover homology and evolution of the dinosaur ankle.
    description: The anklebone (astragalus) of dinosaurs presents a characteristic
      upward projection, the ‘ascending process’ (ASC). The ASC is present in
      modern birds, but develops a separate ossification centre, and projects
      from the calcaneum in most species. These differences have been argued to
      make it non-comparable to dinosaurs. We studied ASC development in six
      different orders of birds using traditional techniques and spin–disc
      microscopy for whole-mount immunofluorescence. Unexpectedly, we found the
      ASC derives from the embryonic intermedium, an ancient element of the
      tetrapod ankle. In some birds it comes in contact with the astragalus,
      and, in others, with the calcaneum. The fact that the intermedium fails to
      fuse early with the tibiale and develops an ossification centre is unlike
      any other amniotes, yet resembles basal, amphibian-grade tetrapods. The
      ASC originated in early dinosaurs along changes to upright posture and
      locomotion, revealing an intriguing combination of functional innovation
      and reversion in its evolution.

    description: "Abstract. Copper, an ion with many important metabolic functions,
      has also been proposed to have a role as modulator on neuronal function,
      mostly based on its effects on voltage‐ and neurotransmitter‐gated
      conductance as well as on neurological symptoms of patients with altered
      copper homeostasis. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which copper exerts
      its neuromodulatory effects have not been clearly established in a
      functional neuronal network. Using rat hippocampus slices as a neuronal
      network model, the effects of copper in the range of 10–100 nm were tested
      on the intrinsic, synaptic and network properties of the CA1 region. Most
      of the previously described effects of this cation were in the micromolar
      range of copper concentrations. The current results indicate that copper
      is a multifaceted neuromodulator, having effects that may be grouped into
      two categories: (i) activity enhancement, by modulating synaptic
      communication and action potential (AP) conductances; and (ii) temporal
      processing and correlation extraction, by improving reliability and
      depressing inhibition. Specifically it was found that copper
      hyperpolarizes AP firing threshold, enhances neuronal and network
      excitability, modifies CA3–CA1 pathway gain, enhances the frequency of
      spontaneous synaptic events, decreases inhibitory network activity, and
      improves AP timing reliability. Moreover, copper chelation by
      bathocuproine decreases spontaneous network spiking activity. These
      results allow the proposal that copper affects the network activity from
      cellular to circuit levels on a moment‐by‐moment basis, and should be
      considered a crucial functional component of hippocampal neuronal
      circuitry."

    title: Early olfactory environment influences social behaviour in adult octodon
      degus.
    description: "Abstract. We evaluated the extent to which manipulation of early
      olfactory environment can influence social behaviours in the South
      American Hystricognath rodent Octodon degus. The early olfactory
      environment of newborn degus was manipulated by scenting all litter
      members with eucalyptol during the first month of life. The social
      behaviour of sexually mature animals (5–7 months old) towards conspecifics
      was then assessed using a y-maze to compare the response of control
      (naïve) and treated animals to two different olfactory configurations
      (experiment 1): (i) a non-familiarized conspecific impregnated with
      eucalyptol (eucalyptol arm) presented against (ii) a non-familiarized
      unscented conspecific (control arm). In addition, in dyadic encounters, we
      assessed the behaviour of control and eucalyptol treated animals towards a
      non-familiarized conspecific scented with eucalyptol (experiment 2). We
      found that control subjects explored and spent significantly less time in
      the eucalyptol arm, indicating neophobic behaviours towards the
      artificially scented conspecific. Treated subjects explored and spent
      similar time in both arms of the maze, showing the same interest for both
      olfactory stimuli presented. During dyadic encounters in experiment 2, an
      interaction effect between early experience and sex was observed. Control
      males escaped and avoided their scented partner more frequently than
      eucalyptol treated male subjects and than females. Both groups did not
      differ in the exploration of their scented partners, suggesting that
      avoidance within agonistic context does not relate to neophobic
      behaviours. Our results suggest that the exposure to eucalyptol during
      early ontogeny decreases evasive behaviours within an agonistic context as
      a result of olfactory learning. Altogether, these results indicate that
      olfactory cues learned in early ontogeny can influence olfactory-guided
      behaviours in adult degus."

    description: "Abstract. Most systematic studies of the avian visual system have
      focused on Neognathous species, leaving virtually unexplored the
      Palaeognathae, comprised of the flightless ratites and the South American
      tinamous. We investigated the visual field, the retinal topography, and
      the pattern of retinal and centrifugal projections in the Chilean tinamou,
      a small Palaeognath of the family Tinamidae. The tinamou has a panoramic
      visual field with a small frontal binocular overlap of 20°. The retina
      possesses three distinct topographic specializations: a horizontal visual
      streak, a dorsotemporal area, and an area centralis with a shallow fovea.
      The maximum ganglion cell density is 61,900/ mm2, comparable to
      Falconiformes. This would provide a maximal visual acuity of 14.0
      cycles/degree, in spite of relatively small eyes. The central retinal
      projections generally conform to the characteristic arrangement observed
      in Neognathae, with well‐differentiated contralateral targets and very few
      ipsilateral fibers. The centrifugal visual system is composed of a
      considerable number of multipolar centrifugal neurons, resembling the
      “ectopic” neurons described in Neognathae. They form a diffuse nuclear
      structure, which may correspond to the ancestral condition shared with
      other sauropsids. A notable feature is the presence of terminals in deep
      tectal layers 11–13. These fibers may represent either a novel
      retinotectal pathway or collateral branches from centrifugal neurons
      projecting to the retina. Both types of connections have been described in
      chicken embryos. Our results widen the basis for comparative studies of
      the vertebrate visual system, stressing the conserved character of the
      visual projections' pattern within the avian clade."

    title: "The isthmic nuclei providing parallel feedback connections to the avian
      tectum have different neurochemical identities: Expression of
      glutamatergic and cholinergic markers in the chick (Gallus gallus)."
    description: "Abstract. Retinal inputs to the optic tectum (TeO) triggered by
      moving stimuli elicit synchronized feedback signals from two isthmic
      nuclei: the isthmi parvocelullaris (Ipc) and isthmi semilunaris (SLu).
      Both of these nuclei send columnar axon terminals back to the same tectal
      position receiving the retinal input. The feedback signals from the Ipc
      seem to act as an attentional spotlight by selectively boosting the
      propagation of retinal inputs from the tectum to higher visual areas.
      Although Ipc and SLu nuclei are widely considered cholinergic because of
      their immunoreactivity for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), contradictory
      findings, including the expression of the vesicular glutamate transporter
      2 (VGluT2) mRNA in Ipc neurons, have raised doubts about the purely
      cholinergic nature of this nucleus. In this study, in chicks, we revise
      the neurochemical identity of the isthmic nuclei by using in situ
      hybridization assays for VGluT2 along with three cholinergic markers: the
      vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), the high‐affinity choline
      transporter (CHT1) and ChAT. We found that neurons in the SLu showed
      strong mRNA expression of all three cholinergic markers, whereas the
      expression of VAChT mRNA in the Ipc was undetectable in our essays.
      Instead, Ipc neurons exhibited a strong expression of VGluT2 mRNA.
      Immunohistochemistry assays showed VGluT2 immunoreactivity in the TeO
      codistributing with anterogradely labeled Ipc axon‐terminal boutons,
      further supporting a glutamatergic function for the Ipc nucleus.
      Therefore, our results strongly suggest that, in the chick, whereas the
      feedback from the SLu to the TeO is indeed cholinergic, the feedback from
      the Ipc has a marked glutamatergic component."

    description: Abstract. Most birds have an opposable digit 1 (hallux) allowing
      the foot to grasp, which evolved from the non-opposable hallux of early
      theropod dinosaurs. An important morphological difference with early
      theropods is the twisting of the long axis of its metatarsal. Here, we
      show how embryonic musculature and the onset of its activity are required
      for twisting of metatarsal 1 (Mt1) and retroversion of the hallux.
      Pharmacologically paralyzed embryos do not fully retrovert the hallux and
      have a straight Mt1 shaft, phenocopying the morphology of early tetanuran
      dinosaurs. Molecular markers of cartilage maturation and ossification show
      that differentiation of Mt1 is significantly delayed compared to Mt2-4. We
      hypothesize on how delayed maturation may have increased plasticity,
      facilitating muscular twisting. Our experimental results emphasize the
      importance of embryonic muscular activity in the evolutionary origin of a
      crucial adaptation.

    title: On the hodological criterion for homology.
    description: "Abstract. Owen's pre-evolutionary definition of a homolog as “the
      same organ in different animals under every variety of form and function”
      and its redefinition after Darwin as “the same trait in different lineages
      due to common ancestry” entail the same heuristic problem: how to
      establish “sameness.”Although different criteria for homology often
      conflict, there is currently a generalized acceptance of gene expression
      as the best criterion. This gene-centered view of homology results from a
      reductionist and preformationist concept of living beings. Here, we adopt
      an alternative organismic-epigenetic viewpoint, and conceive living beings
      as systems whose identity is given by the dynamic interactions between
      their components at their multiple levels of composition. We posit that
      there cannot be an absolute homology criterion, and instead, homology
      should be inferred from comparisons at the levels and developmental stages
      where the delimitation of the compared trait lies. In this line, we argue
      that neural connectivity, i.e., the hodological criterion, should prevail
      in the determination of homologies between brain supra-cellular
      structures, such as the vertebrate pallium."

    title: Zebrin II expression in the cerebellum of a Paleognathous bird, the
      Chilean tinamou (Nothoprocta perdicaria).
    description: "Abstract. Zebrin II (ZII) is a glycolytic enzyme expressed in
      cerebellar Purkinje cells. In both mammals and birds, ZII is expressed
      heterogeneously, such that there are sagittal stripes of Purkinje cells
      with a high ZII expression (ZII+) alternating with stripes of Purkinje
      cells with little or no expression (ZII-). To date, ZII expression studies
      are limited to neognathous birds: pigeons (Columbiformes), chickens
      (Galliformes), and hummingbirds (Trochilidae). These previous studies
      divided the avian cerebellum into 5 transverse regions based on the
      pattern of ZII expression. In the lingular region (lobule I) all Purkinje
      cells are ZII+. In the anterior region (lobules II-V) there are 4 pairs of
      ZII+/- stripes. In the central region (lobules VI-VIII) all Purkinje cells
      are ZII+. In the posterior region (lobules VIII-IX) there are 5-7 pairs of
      ZII+/- stripes. Finally, in the nodular region (lobule X) all Purkinje
      cells are ZII+. As the pattern of ZII stripes is quite similar in these
      disparate species, it appears that it is highly conserved. However, it has
      yet to be studied in paleognathous birds, which split from the neognaths
      over 100 million years ago. To better understand the evolution of
      cerebellar compartmentation in birds, we examined ZII immunoreactivity in
      a paleognath, the Chilean tinamou (Nothoprocta perdicaria). In the
      tinamou, Purkinje cells expressed ZII heterogeneously such that there were
      sagittal ZII+ and ZII- stripes of Purkinje cells, and this pattern of
      expression was largely similar to that observed in neognathous birds. For
      example, all Purkinje cells in the lingular (lobule I) and nodular (lobule
      X) regions were ZII+, and there were 4 pairs of ZII+/- stripes in the
      anterior region (lobules II-V). In contrast to neognaths, however, ZII was
      expressed in lobules VI-VII as a series of sagittal stripes in the
      tinamou. Also unlike in neognaths, stripes were absent in lobule IXab, and
      all Purkinje cells expressed ZII in the tinamou. The differences in ZII
      expression between the tinamou and neognaths could reflect behavior, but
      the general similarity of the expression patterns across all bird species
      suggests that ZII stripes evolved early in the avian phylogenetic tree."

    title: "Anatomical organization of the visual dorsal ventricular ridge in the
      chick (Gallus gallus): Layers and columns in the avian pallium."
    description: Abstract. The dorsal ventricular ridge (DVR) is one of the main
      components of the sauropsid pallium. In birds, the DVR is formed by an
      inner region, the nidopallium, and a more dorsal region, the mesopallium.
      The nidopallium contains discrete areas that receive auditory, visual, and
      multisensory collothalamic projections. These nidopallial nuclei are known
      to sustain reciprocal, short‐range projections with their overlying
      mesopallial areas. Recent findings on the anatomical organization of the
      auditory DVR have shown that these short‐range projections have a columnar
      organization that closely resembles that of the mammalian neocortex.
      However, it is unclear whether this columnar organization generalizes to
      other areas within the DVR. Here we examine in detail the organization of
      the visual DVR, performing small, circumscribed deposits of neuronal
      tracers as well as intracellular fillings in brain slices. We show that
      the visual DVR is organized in three main laminae, the thalamorecipient
      nucleus entopallium; a dorsally adjacent nidopallial lamina, the
      intermediate nidopallium; and a contiguous portion of the ventral
      mesopallium, the mesopallium ventrale. As in the case of the auditory DVR,
      we found a highly topographically organized system of reciprocal
      interconnections among these layers, which was formed by dorsoventrally
      oriented, discrete columnar bundles of axons. We conclude that the
      columnar organization previously demonstrated in the auditory DVR is not a
      unique feature but a general characteristic of the avian sensory pallium.
      We discuss these results in the context of a comparison between sauropsid
      and mammalian pallial organization.

    description: Abstract. The nucleus geniculatus lateralis pars ventralis (GLv) is
      a prominent retinal target in all amniotes. In birds, it is in receipt of
      a dense and topographically organized retinal projection. The GLv is also
      the target of substantial and topographically organized projections from
      the optic tectum and the visual wulst (hyperpallium). Tectal and retinal
      afferents terminate homotopically within the external GLv‐neuropil.
      Efferents from the GLv follow a descending course through the tegmentum
      and can be traced into the medial pontine nucleus. At present, the cells
      of origin of the Tecto‐GLv projection are only partially described. Here
      we characterized the laminar location, morphology, projection pattern, and
      neurochemical identity of these cells by means of neural tracer injections
      and intracellular fillings in slice preparations and extracellular tracer
      injections in vivo. The Tecto‐GLv projection arises from a distinct subset
      of layer 10 bipolar neurons, whose apical dendrites show a complex
      transverse arborization at the level of layer 7. Axons of these bipolar
      cells arise from the apical dendrites and follow a course through the
      optic tract to finally form very fine and restricted terminal endings
      inside the GLv‐neuropil. Double‐label experiments showed that these
      bipolar cells were choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)‐immunoreactive. Our
      results strongly suggest that Tecto‐GLv neurons form a pathway by which
      integrated tectal activity rapidly feeds back to the GLv and exerts a
      focal cholinergic modulation of incoming retinal inputs.

    title: Extracellular recordings reveal absence of magneto sensitive units in the
      avian optic tectum.
    description: Abstract. There is a consensus that birds detect the earth’s
      magnetic field and use some of its features for orientation and homing
      purposes. Since the late 1960s, when the first solid behavioral evidence
      of magnetoreception was obtained, much research has been devoted to
      describing the ethological aspects of this behavior. The
      neurophysiological basis of magnetoreception has been much less studied,
      although a frequently cited 1986 report described a high prevalence (70 %)
      of magneto-sensitive neurons in the pigeon optic tectum with high
      signal-to-noise ratios (Semm and Demaine, J Comp Physiol A 159:619–625,
      1986). Here, we repeated these neurophysiological experiments using
      anesthetized as well as awake pigeons and new recording techniques. Our
      data indicate that magneto-sensitive units do not exist in the avian
      tectum.

    title: "Electroablation: a method for neurectomy and localized tissue injury."
    description: "Abstract. Background: Tissue injury has been employed to study
      diverse biological processes such as regeneration and inflammation. In
      addition to physical or surgical based methods for tissue injury, current
      protocols for localized tissue damage include laser and two-photon
      wounding, which allow a high degree of accuracy, but are expensive and
      difficult to apply. In contrast, electrical injury is a simple and
      inexpensive technique, which allows reproducible and localized cell or
      tissue damage in a variety of contexts. Results: We describe a novel
      technique that combines the advantages of zebrafish for in vivo
      visualization of cells with those of electrical injury methods in a simple
      and versatile protocol which allows the study of regeneration and
      inflammation. The source of the electrical pulse is a microelectrode that
      can be placed with precision adjacent to specific cells expressing
      fluorescent proteins. We demonstrate the use of this technique in
      zebrafish larvae by damaging different cell types and structures.
      Neurectomy can be carried out in peripheral nerves or in the spinal cord
      allowing the study of degeneration and regeneration of nerve fibers. We
      also apply this method for the ablation of single lateral line
      mechanosensory neuromasts, showing the utility of this approach as a tool
      for the study of organ regeneration. In addition, we show that electrical
      injury induces immune cell recruitment to damaged tissues, allowing in
      vivo studies of leukocyte dynamics during inflammation within a confined
      and localized injury. Finally, we show that it is possible to apply
      electroablation as a method of tissue injury and inflammation induction in
      adult fish. Conclusions: Electrical injury using a fine microelectrode can
      be used for axotomy of neurons, as a general tissue ablation tool and as a
      method to induce a powerful inflammatory response. We demonstrate its
      utility to studies in both larvae and in adult zebrafish but we expect
      that this technique can be readily applied to other organisms as well. We
      have called this method of electrical based tissue ablation,
      electroablation."

    description: Abstract. In scatter-hoarding species, several behavioral and
      neuroanatomical adaptations allow them to store and retrieve thousands of
      food items per year. Nectarivorous animals face a similar scenario having
      to remember quality, location and replenishment schedules of several
      nectar sources. In the green-backed firecrown hummingbird (Sephanoides
      sephanoides), males are territorial and have the ability to accurately
      keep track of nectar characteristics of their defended food sources. In
      contrast, females display an opportunistic strategy, performing rapid
      intrusions into males territories. In response, males behave aggressively
      during the non-reproductive season. In addition, females have higher
      energetic demands due to higher thermoregulatory costs and travel times.
      The natural scenario of this species led us to compared cognitive
      abilities and hippocampal size between males and females. Males were able
      to remember nectar location and renewal rates significantly better than
      females. However, the hippocampal formation was significantly larger in
      females than males. We discuss these findings in terms of sexually
      dimorphic use of spatial resources and variable patterns of brain
      dimorphisms in birds.

    title: Does nocturnality drive binocular vision? Octodontine rodents as a case
      study.
    description: "Abstract. Binocular vision is a visual property that allows fine
      discrimination of in-depth distance (stereopsis), as well as enhanced
      light and contrast sensitivity. In mammals enhanced binocular vision is
      structurally associated with a large degree of frontal binocular overlap,
      the presence of a corresponding retinal specialization containing a fovea
      or an area centralis, and well-developed ipsilateral retinal projections
      to the lateral thalamus (GLd). We compared these visual traits in two
      visually active species of the genus Octodon that exhibit contrasting
      visual habits: the diurnal Octodon degus, and the nocturnal Octodon
      lunatus. The O. lunatus visual field has a prominent 100° frontal
      binocular overlap, much larger than the 50° of overlap found in O. degus.
      Cells in the retinal ganglion cell layer were 40% fewer in O. lunatus
      (180,000) than in O. degus (300,000). O. lunatus has a poorly developed
      visual streak, but a well developed area centralis, located centrally near
      the optic disk (peak density of 4,352 cells/mm2). O. degus has a highly
      developed visual streak, and an area centralis located more temporally
      (peak density of 6,384 cells/mm2). The volumes of the contralateral GLd
      and superior colliculus (SC) are 15% larger in O. degus compared to O.
      lunatus. However, the ipsilateral projections to GLd and SC are 500%
      larger in O. lunatus than in O. degus. Other retinorecipient structures
      related to ocular movements and circadian activity showed no statistical
      differences between species. Our findings strongly suggest that nocturnal
      visual behavior leads to an enhancement of the structures associated with
      binocular vision, at least in the case of these rodents. Expansion of the
      binocular visual field in nocturnal species may have a beneficial effect
      in light and contrast sensitivity, but not necessarily in stereopsis. We
      discuss whether these conclusions can be extended to other mammalian and
      non-mammalian amniotes."

    description: "Abstract. The isthmic complex is part of a visual midbrain circuit
      thought to be involved in stimulus selection and spatial attention. In
      birds, this circuit is composed of the nuclei isthmi pars magnocellularis
      (Imc), pars parvocellularis (Ipc), and pars semilunaris (SLu), all of them
      reciprocally connected to the ipsilateral optic tectum (TeO). The Imc
      conveys heterotopic inhibition to the TeO, Ipc, and SLu via widespread
      γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic axons that allow global competitive
      interactions among simultaneous sensory inputs. Anatomical studies in the
      chick have described a cytoarchitectonically uniform Imc nucleus
      containing two intermingled cell types: one projecting to the Ipc and SLu
      and the other to the TeO. Here we report that in passerine species, the
      Imc is segregated into an internal division displaying larger, sparsely
      distributed cells, and an external division displaying smaller, more
      densely packed cells. In vivo and in vitro injections of neural tracers in
      the TeO and the Ipc of the zebra finch demonstrated that neurons from the
      external and internal subdivisions project to the Ipc and the TeO,
      respectively, indicating that each Imc subdivision contains one of the two
      cell types hodologically defined in the chick. In an extensive survey
      across avian orders, we found that, in addition to passerines, only
      species of Piciformes and Rallidae exhibited a segregated Imc, whereas all
      other groups exhibited a uniform Imc. These results offer a comparative
      basis to investigate the functional role played by each Imc neural type in
      the competitive interactions mediated by this nucleus."

    title: Attentional capture? Synchronized feedback signals from the isthmi boost
      retinal signals to higher visual areas.
    description: Abstract. When a salient object in the visual field captures
      attention, the neural representation of that object is enhanced at the
      expense of competing stimuli. How neural activity evoked by a salient
      stimulus evolves to take precedence over the neural activity evoked by
      other stimuli is a matter of intensive investigation. Here, we describe in
      pigeons (Columba livia) how retinal inputs to the optic tectum (TeO,
      superior colliculus in mammals), triggered by moving stimuli, are
      selectively relayed on to the rotundus (Rt, caudal pulvinar) in the
      thalamus, and to its pallial target, the entopallium (E, extrastriate
      cortex). We show that two satellite nuclei of the TeO, the nucleus isthmi
      parvocelullaris (Ipc) and isthmi semilunaris (SLu), send synchronized
      feedback signals across tectal layers. Preventing the feedback from Ipc
      but not from SLu to a tectal location suppresses visual responses to
      moving stimuli from the corresponding region of visual space in all Rt
      subdivisions. In addition, the bursting feedback from the Ipc imprints a
      bursting rhythm on the visual signals, such that the visual responses of
      the Rt and the E acquire a bursting modulation significantly synchronized
      to the feedback from Ipc. As the Ipc feedback signals are selected by
      competitive interactions, the visual responses within the receptive fields
      in the Rt tend to synchronize with the tectal location receiving the
      “winning” feedback from Ipc. We propose that this selective transmission
      of afferent activity combined with the cross-regional synchronization of
      the areas involved represents a bottom-up mechanism by which salient
      stimuli capture attention.

    title: Functional implications of species differences in the size and morphology
      of the isthmo optic nucleus (ION) in birds.
    description: "Abstract. In birds, there is a retinofugal projection from the
      brain to the retina originating from the isthmo optic nucleus (ION) in the
      midbrain. Despite a large number of anatomical, physiological and
      histochemical studies, the function of this retinofugal system remains
      unclear. Several functions have been proposed including: gaze
      stabilization, pecking behavior, dark adaptation, shifting attention, and
      detection of aerial predators. This nucleus varies in size and
      organization among some species, but the relative size and morphology of
      the ION has not been systematically studied. Here, we present a comparison
      of the relative size and morphology of the ION in 81 species of birds,
      representing 17 different orders. Our results show that several orders of
      birds, besides those previously reported, have a large, well-organized
      ION, including: hummingbirds, woodpeckers, coots and allies, and
      kingfishers. At the other end of the spectrum, parrots, herons, waterfowl,
      owls and diurnal raptors have relatively small ION volumes. ION also
      appears to be absent or unrecognizable is several taxa, including one of
      the basal avian groups, the tinamous, which suggests that the ION may have
      evolved only in the more modern group of birds, Neognathae. Finally, we
      demonstrate that evolutionary changes in the relative size and the
      cytoarchitectonic organization of ION have occurred largely independent of
      phylogeny. The large relative size of the ION in orders with very
      different lifestyles and feeding behaviors suggest there is no clear
      association with pecking behavior or predator detection. Instead, our
      results suggest that the ION is more complex and enlarged in birds that
      have eyes that are emmetropic in some parts of the visual field and myopic
      in others. We therefore posit that the ION is involved in switching
      attention between two parts of the retina i.e. from an emmetropic to a
      myopic part of the retina."

    description: Abstract. The mammalian pulvinar complex is a collection of dorsal
      thalamic nuclei related to several visual and integrative processes.
      Previous studies have shown that the superficial layers of the superior
      colliculus project to multiple divisions of the pulvinar complex. Although
      most of these works agree about the existence of an ipsilateral
      tectopulvinar projection arising from the stratum griseum superficialis,
      some others report a bilateral projection originating from this same
      tectal layer. We investigated the organization of the tectopulvinar
      projections in the Californian ground squirrel using cholera toxin B
      (CTb). We confirmed previous studies showing that the caudal pulvinar of
      the squirrel receives a massive bilateral projection originating from a
      specific cell population located in the superficial collicular layers
      (SGS3, also called the “lower SGS” or “SGSL”). We found that this
      projection shares striking structural similarities with the tectorotundal
      pathway of birds and reptiles. Morphology of the collicular cells
      originating this projection closely corresponds to that of the bottlebrush
      tectal cells described previously for chickens and squirrels. In addition,
      we found that the rostral pulvinar receives an exclusively ipsilateral
      projection from a spatially separate population of collicular cells
      located at the base of the stratum opticum, deeper than the cells
      projecting to the caudal pulvinar. These results strongly support, at a
      structural level, the homology of the pathway originating in the SGS3
      collicular cells upon the caudal pulvinar with the tectorotundal pathway
      of nonmammalian amniotes and contribute to clarifying the general
      organization of the tectopulvinar pathways in mammals.

    description: Abstract. The vomeronasal system is crucial for social and sexual
      communication in mammals. Two populations of vomeronasal sensory neurons,
      each expressing Gαi2 or Gαo proteins, send projections to glomeruli of the
      rostral or caudal accessory olfactory bulb, rAOB and cAOB, respectively.
      In rodents, the Gαi2‐ and Gαo‐expressing vomeronasal pathways have shown
      differential responses to small/volatile vs. large/non‐volatile
      semiochemicals, respectively. Moreover, early gene expression suggests
      predominant activation of rAOB and cAOB neurons in sexual vs. aggressive
      contexts, respectively. We recently described the AOB of Octodon degus, a
      semiarid‐inhabiting diurnal caviomorph. Their AOB has a cell indentation
      between subdomains and the rAOB is twice the size of the cAOB. Moreover,
      their AOB receives innervation from the lateral aspect, contrasting with
      the medial innervation of all other mammals examined to date. Aiming to
      relate AOB anatomy with lifestyle, we performed a morphometric study on
      the AOB of the capybara, a semiaquatic caviomorph whose lifestyle differs
      remarkably from that of O. degus. Capybaras mate in water and scent‐mark
      their surroundings with oily deposits, mostly for male–male communication.
      We found that, similar to O. degus, the AOB of capybaras shows a lateral
      innervation of the vomeronasal nerve, a cell indentation between
      subdomains and heterogeneous subdomains, but in contrast to O. degus the
      caudal portion is larger than the rostral one. We also observed that four
      other caviomorph species present a lateral AOB innervation and a cell
      indentation between AOB subdomains, suggesting that those traits could
      represent apomorphies of the group. We propose that although some AOB
      traits may be phylogenetically conserved in caviomorphs, ecological
      specializations may play an important role in shaping the AOB.

    title: Deterioration of the Gαo vomeronasal pathway in sexually dimorphic mammals.
    description: "Abstract. In mammals, social and sexual behaviours are largely
      mediated by the vomeronasal system (VNS). The accessory olfactory bulb
      (AOB) is the first synaptic locus of the VNS and ranges from very large in
      Caviomorph rodents, small in carnivores and ungulates, to its complete
      absence in apes, elephants, most bats and aquatic species. Two pathways
      have been described in the VNS of mammals. In mice, vomeronasal neurons
      expressing Gαi2 protein project to the rostral portion of the AOB and
      respond mostly to small volatile molecules, whereas neurons expressing Gαo
      project to the caudal AOB and respond mostly to large non-volatile
      molecules. However, the Gαo-expressing pathway is absent in several
      species (horses, dogs, musk shrews, goats and marmosets) but no hypotheses
      have been proposed to date to explain the loss of that pathway. We noted
      that the species that lost the Gαo pathway belong to Laurasiatheria and
      Primates lineages, both clades with ubiquitous sexual dimorphisms across
      species. To assess whether similar events of Gαo pathway loss could have
      occurred convergently in dimorphic species we studied G-protein expression
      in the AOB of two species that independently evolved sexually dimorphic
      traits: the California ground squirrel Spermophilus beecheyi (Rodentia;
      Sciurognathi) and the cape hyrax Procavia capensis (Afrotheria;
      Hyracoidea). We found that both species show uniform expression of
      Gαi2-protein throughout AOB glomeruli, while Gαo expression is restricted
      to main olfactory glomeruli only. Our results suggest that the
      degeneration of the Gαo-expressing vomeronasal pathway has occurred
      independently at least four times in Eutheria, possibly related to the
      emergence of sexual dimorphisms and the ability of detecting the gender of
      conspecifics at distance."

    title: "From L'Homme Machine to metabolic closure: Steps towards understanding
      life."
    description: Abstract. The nature of life has been a topic of interest from the
      earliest of times, and efforts to explain it in mechanistic terms date at
      least from the 18th century. However, the impressive development of
      molecular biology since the 1950s has tended to have the question put on
      one side while biologists explore mechanisms in greater and greater
      detail, with the result that studies of life as such have been confined to
      a rather small group of researchers who have ignored one another's work
      almost completely, often using quite different terminology to present very
      similar ideas. Central among these ideas is that of closure, which implies
      that all of the catalysts needed for an organism to stay alive must be
      produced by the organism itself, relying on nothing apart from food (and
      hence chemical energy) from outside. The theories that embody this idea to
      a greater or less degree are known by a variety of names, including (M,R)
      systems, autopoiesis, the chemoton, the hypercycle, symbiosis,
      autocatalytic sets, sysers and RAF sets. These are not all the same, but
      they are not completely different either, and in this review we examine
      their similarities and differences, with the aim of working towards the
      formulation of a unified theory of life.

    description: Abstract. It has been argued that trichromatic bees with
      photoreceptor spectral sensitivity peaks in the ultraviolet (UV), blue and
      green areas of the spectrum are blind to long wavelengths (red to humans).
      South American temperate forests (SATF) contain a large number of human
      red-looking flowers that are reported to be visited by the bumblebee
      Bombus dahlbomii. In the present study, B. dahlbomii's spectral
      sensitivity was measured through electroretinogram (ERG) recordings. No
      extended sensitivity to long wavelengths was found in B. dahlbomii. The
      spectral reflectance curves from eight plant species with red flowers were
      measured. The color loci occupied by these flowers in the bee color space
      was evaluated using the receptor noise-limited model. Four of the plant
      species have pure red flowers with low levels of chromatic contrast but
      high levels of negative L-receptor contrast. Finally, training experiments
      were performed in order to assess the role of achromatic cues in the
      detection and discrimination of red targets by B. dahlbomii. The results
      of the training experiments suggest that the bumblebee relies on
      achromatic contrast provided by the L-receptor to detect and discriminate
      red targets. These findings are discussed in the context of the
      evolutionary background under which the relationship between SATF species
      and their flower visitors may have evolved.

    description: Abstract. The major insight in Robert Rosen's view of a living
      organism as an (M,R)-system was the realization that an organism must be
      “closed to efficient causation”, which means that the catalysts needed for
      its operation must be generated internally. This aspect is not
      controversial, but there has been confusion and misunderstanding about the
      logic Rosen used to achieve this closure. In addition, his corollary that
      an organism is not a mechanism and cannot have simulable models has led to
      much argument, most of it mathematical in nature and difficult to
      appreciate. Here we examine some of the mathematical arguments and clarify
      the conditions for closure.

    title: Topographic arrangement of the rotundo‐entopallial projection in the
      pigeon (Columba livia),
    description: Abstract. The tectofugal pathway (retina – optic tectum – nucleus
      rotundus – entopallium) is a prominent route mediating visual
      discrimination in diurnal birds. Several lines of evidence have shown that
      at the tecto‐rotundal stage this pathway is composed of multiple parallel
      channels. Anatomical studies show that the nucleus rotundus is composed of
      at least four subdivisions, according to differences in cytoarchitectonic,
      histochemical, and hodological properties. Each of these subdivisions is
      in receipt of a highly convergent, nontopographic tectal projection,
      originating from a distinct subset of tecto‐rotundal neurons.
      Physiological studies show that neurons of different subdivisions respond
      specifically to different visual dimensions, such as color, luminance,
      two‐dimensional motion, and in‐depth motion. At present it is less clear
      whether or to what extent this channel segregation is preserved at the
      telencephalic stage of the tectofugal pathway. The entopallium shows no
      obvious subdivisions or laminations. Nevertheless, tract‐tracing
      experiments show that separate portions of the entopallium receive
      efferent projections from different rotundal subdivisions, in a way that
      maintains the rostrocaudal order of these subdivisions. In the present
      study we investigate in detail the topography of the rotundo‐entopallial
      projection by means of anterograde and retrograde neuronal tracers. Our
      results confirm the zonal topography proposed by previous studies and
      indicate that each zone in the entopallium receives a direct and
      topographically organized projection from its corresponding rotundal
      subdivision. These results suggest that the spatial arrangement of the
      different rotundal functional modules is preserved at the entopallial
      level.

      Abstract. A highly conserved spatio-temporal pattern of cartilage
      formation reveals that the digits of the bird wing develop from positions
      that become digits 2, 3, and 4 in other amniotes. However, the morphology
      of the digits of early birds like Archaeopteryx corresponds to that of
      digits 1, 2, and 3 of other archosaurs. A hypothesis is that a homeotic
      "frame-shift" occurred, such that in the bird wing, digits 1, 2, and 3
      develop from the embryological positions of digits 2, 3, and 4.
      Experimental homeotic transformations of single digits are
      well-documented, but frame-shifts of more than one digit are not. We
      investigated the pattern of cartilage formation in the development of
      Cyclopamine-treated wings. When Cyclopamine was applied between stages 18
      and 21, morphologies that normally develop from positions 2 and 3
      developed from positions 3 and 4. The serial shift of digit identity
      toward posterior confirms a mechanistic possibility that was previously
      inferred from the evolutionary history of birds.
